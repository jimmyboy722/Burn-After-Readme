## Why do web dev projects need a good README file? The answer to this question is extensive, so I'll stick to the main ideas...
- Provides a description of what your program/product is used for along with some insite as to why it was created.
- Evinces the value of your project.
- Makes it easy for other developers to understand and collaborate on, should they chose to.

## Installation Instructions
In order to create this README generator, I had to download the following:
- Node.js. This is the runtime environment I used in conjunciton with my IDE to code this project. You can download the current version of node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en)
- ![node screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77cd0435-19f8-4444-8ed1-0f27b24bfc03)
- Once node.js is installed, you have to install the inquirer package with npm. Version 8.2.4
- ![inquirer screen shot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0e7af4d-ad04-4788-97c3-27d4eff9261d)

## Usage
 - To use this generator, simply run the command `node index.js` in your terminal and the npm inquirer's *prompt* method will (no pun intended) prompt you to answer questions needed to generate your README.

## In-Summary
The README of any project could be what makes it sink or swim. First impressions are the most important, and I hope I've made a good one on you.
